### Personal Overview ðŸ’»

I have 21 years, starting learning Rust language.

My professional idea is to be the full stack developer, trying to learn all sides of languages and softwares learning.

The games in general was an inspiration to start programming, i used to took some source codes and modified by myself before i really started in programation, now I'm focusing on studying, always keeping in mind the organization of the code, this is my dilemma.

I am a person who tries to make the code as readable as possible, always leaving comments in the code sections, making the life easier for people that need a help with my codes.
