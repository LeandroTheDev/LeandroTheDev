### Personal Overview ðŸ’»

My professional idea is to be a full stack developer, trying to learn all sides of languages and softwares learning.

The games in general was an inspiration to start programming, i used to took some source codes and modified by myself before i really started in programming, now I'm focusing on studying, always keeping in mind the organization of the code, this is my dilemma.

I am a person who tries to make the code as readable as possible, always leaving comments in the code sections, making the life easier for people that need a help with my codes.

Always following the good code practices, and a FTM developer projects, take a time and see my [portfolio](http://leandrothedev.duckdns.org)
