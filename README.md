### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have 21 years, learning flutter. 
I'm looking for developer jobs.


The games in general was an inspiration to start programming, i used to took some source codes and modified by myself before i really started in programation, now I'm focusing on studying the front end flutter/react, always keeping in mind the organization of the code.

I am a person who tries to make the code as readable as possible, always leaving comments in the code sections.
